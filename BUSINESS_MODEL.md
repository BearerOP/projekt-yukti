# Yukti - Opinion Trading Platform: Business Model & Profitability

## Executive Summary

Yukti is a prediction market platform that enables users to bet on real-world events using a decentralized Automated Market Maker (AMM) system on Solana blockchain. The platform generates revenue through platform fees while providing an engaging, transparent, and secure betting experience.

## Revenue Streams

### 1. Platform Fees (Primary Revenue Source)

**Fee Structure**: 2% commission on winning payouts

**How it Works**:
- Users place bids on poll outcomes (YES/NO)
- When the poll is settled, winners receive their potential winnings
- Platform deducts 2% fee from the winning amount
- Losers forfeit their entire bid amount (goes to winner pool)

**Example Transaction**:
```
User bids: ₹1,000 on "YES" at 0.6 odds
Poll settles: "YES" wins
Potential win: ₹1,000 / 0.6 = ₹1,667
Platform fee (2%): ₹1,667 × 0.02 = ₹33.34
User receives: ₹1,667 - ₹33.34 = ₹1,633.66
Platform profit: ₹33.34
```

### 2. On-Chain Transaction Fees (Solana)

**On-Chain Operations**:
- Poll initialization fees
- Bid placement fees
- Settlement fees
- Escrow management

**Fee Model**:
- Small fixed fee per transaction (e.g., 0.001 SOL ≈ ₹0.10)
- Covers blockchain gas costs with slight margin

```
10,000 tx × ₹0.10 = ₹1,000 profit/month
